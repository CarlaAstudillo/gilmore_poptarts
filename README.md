##reimagined as Pop-Tarts

Where I make every episode of Gilmore Girls into pop-tarts using the ratings from the [Gilmore Guys podcasts](http://www.gilmoreguysshow.com), IMDB scores, episode pop culture references and certain character appearances. The data is crowdsourced so let me know if you see an error. :)

This project was heavily inspired by [Shirley Wu's](https://twitter.com/sxywu) amazing [film flowers](http://bl.ocks.org/sxywu/raw/d612c6c653fb8b4d7ff3d422be164a5d/) which I strongly encourage everyone to check out.

**Sources:** [Gilmore Guys Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Guys), [Gilmore Girls Wiki](http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Gilmorepedia), [IMDB.com](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238784/) // **Ruler Icon:** Noun Project (Arthur Shlain)  
***Note:** 1.12 Double Date episode was reviewed only by Kevin and not Demi, so I made the both width and height Kevin's score.
